Minimum Number of Food Buckets to Feed the Hamsters
LeetCode Problem No. 2086

Medium

You are given a 0-indexed string hamsters where hamsters[i] is either:

'H' indicating that there is a hamster at index i, or
'.' indicating that index i is empty.
You will add some number of food buckets at the empty indices in order to feed the hamsters. A hamster can be fed if there is at least one food bucket to its left or to its right. More formally, a hamster at index i can be fed if you place a food bucket at index i - 1 and/or at index i + 1.

Return the minimum number of food buckets you should place at empty indices to feed all the hamsters or -1 if it is impossible to feed all of them.

Input: hamsters = "H..H"
Output: 2
Explanation: We place two food buckets at indices 1 and 2.
It can be shown that if we place only one food bucket, one of the hamsters will not be fed.

Input: hamsters = ".H.H."
Output: 1
Explanation: We place one food bucket at index 2.

Input: hamsters = ".HHH."
Output: -1
Explanation: If we place a food bucket at every empty index as shown, the hamster at index 2 will not be able to eat.

Notes
üîç Intuition
We want to greedily place a bucket at the most optimal location for each hamster, while minimizing overlap and avoiding double-placing.

The best spot to put a bucket for an 'H' is at i + 1 if it‚Äôs a dot, because:

It feeds the hamster at i.

It might also feed the next hamster at i + 2.

But we have to be careful to avoid conflicts like placing buckets that don‚Äôt help or double feeding unnecessarily.
üí° Greedy Strategy
Loop through the string:

When you see an 'H':

First, check if a bucket is already placed at i - 1 (we can skip this hamster).

Next, try placing a bucket at i + 1, if it‚Äôs a '.' Mark it as 'B'.

If that‚Äôs not possible, try placing a bucket at i - 1, if it‚Äôs a '.'.

If neither is possible, return -1 (this hamster can‚Äôt be fed).
