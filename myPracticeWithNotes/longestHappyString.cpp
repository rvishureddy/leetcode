/*
A string s is called happy if it satisfies the following conditions:

s only contains the letters 'a', 'b', and 'c'.
s does not contain any of "aaa", "bbb", or "ccc" as a substring.
s contains at most a occurrences of the letter 'a'.
s contains at most b occurrences of the letter 'b'.
s contains at most c occurrences of the letter 'c'.
Given three integers a, b, and c, return the longest possible happy string. If there are multiple longest happy strings, return any of them. If there is no such string, return the empty string "".

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.



Example 1:

Input: a = 1, b = 1, c = 7
Output: "ccaccbcc"
Explanation: "ccbccacc" would also be a correct answer.
Example 2:

Input: a = 7, b = 1, c = 0
Output: "aabaa"
Explanation: It is the only correct answer in this case.

üîç Key Idea:
At every step, greedily choose the character with the most remaining count ‚Äî unless it would cause 3 in a row.

If it would cause 3 in a row, use the next best (second most frequent character) instead.

üõ†Ô∏è Data Structure:
Use a max heap (priority queue) to always pick the character with the most remaining count.

üîÅ Algorithm (Greedy + Priority Queue):
Put (count, char) pairs into a max heap (using negative count for max-heap behavior).

While the heap is not empty:

Pop the char with highest remaining count.

If the last two characters in the result are the same as this character, we can't use it. Try the next one.

If we can't use any character, we're done.

Else, use the character, update its count, and push it back into the heap if it still has remaining count.
