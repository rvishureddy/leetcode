/*
You are given a string road, consisting only of characters "x" and ".", where each "x" denotes a pothole and each "." denotes a smooth road, along with an integer budget.

In one repair operation, you can repair n consecutive potholes for a price of n + 1.

Return the maximum number of potholes that can be fixed such that the sum of the costs of all repairs doesn't exceed the given budget.

Notes:
‚úÖ Problem: Max Number of Potholes Repaired Within Budget
üß† Problem Summary:
You're given a string road with 'x' representing potholes and '.' as smooth road, along with a budget.

Repair cost for n consecutive potholes = n + 1

You can only repair complete segments, but if budget is tight, you may partially repair the final segment.

Goal: Maximize the number of potholes repaired within the given budget.

üõ†Ô∏è Approach Summary:
Traverse the string and find segments of consecutive 'x's.

Store each as {segment_length, segment_cost} in a vector.

Sort segments by ascending cost.

Greedily repair as many full segments as possible.

If one full segment exceeds budget, partially repair it:

You can fix budget_remaining - 1 potholes (since cost = potholes + 1).

üîç Key Techniques:
Greedy Strategy: Choose cheapest segments first.

Segment Preprocessing: Add a . at the end to capture trailing segments.

Custom Comparator: Sort by cost to optimize budget usage.

Edge Handling:

Handles trailing potholes (push_back('.'))

Allows partial repair of final unaffordable segment

üßÆ Time & Space:
Time: O(n log n) ‚Äì due to sorting segment costs

Space: O(n) ‚Äì worst case all 1-length pothole segments

üìå Notes for Interviews:
This problem is a classic greedy pattern with twist: full vs. partial repair trade-off.

Be ready to explain why you sort by cost, and how partial repair logic works.

Can lead into follow-up system design questions about batching, budget constraints, or real-world sensor signal prioritization.
