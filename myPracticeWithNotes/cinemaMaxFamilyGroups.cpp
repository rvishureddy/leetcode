/*
A cinema has n rows of seats, numbered from 1 to n and there are ten seats in each row, labelled from 1 to 10 as shown in the figure above.

Given the array reservedSeats containing the numbers of seats already reserved, for example, reservedSeats[i] = [3,8] means the seat located in row 3 and labelled with 8 is already reserved.

Return the maximum number of four-person groups you can assign on the cinema seats. A four-person group occupies four adjacent seats in one single row. Seats across an aisle (such as [3,3] and [3,4]) are not considered to be adjacent, but there is an exceptional case on which an aisle split a four-person group, in that case, the aisle split a four-person group in the middle, which means to have two people on each side.

 1 2 3   4 5 6 7   8 9 10
 _ _ _   _ _ _ _   _ _ _

Example 1:

Input: n = 3, reservedSeats = [[1,2],[1,3],[1,8],[2,6],[3,1],[3,10]]
Output: 4
Explanation: The figure above shows the optimal allocation for four groups, where seats mark with blue are already reserved and contiguous seats mark with orange are for one group.
Example 2:

Input: n = 2, reservedSeats = [[2,1],[1,8],[2,6]]
Output: 2
Example 3:

Input: n = 4, reservedSeats = [[4,3],[1,4],[4,6],[1,7]]
Output: 4


Constraints:

1 <= n <= 10^9
1 <= reservedSeats.length <= min(10*n, 10^4)
reservedSeats[i].length == 2
1 <= reservedSeats[i][0] <= n
1 <= reservedSeats[i][1] <= 10
All reservedSeats[i] are distinct.

We are given:

n rows in a cinema.

Each row has 10 seats labeled 1 to 10.

A group of 4 people needs 4 adjacent seats in the same row, but cannot span across aisles (between seat 3â€“4 or 7â€“8).

Valid group blocks are:

Left block: seats 2,3,4,5

Right block: seats 6,7,8,9

Middle block: seats 4,5,6,7 (this is allowed even though it straddles an aisle)

So a reserved seat at column col will set bit 1 << col.

ðŸŽ¯ Predefined Block Masks:
                         10 9 8  7 6 5 4  3 2 1   Bits
Left block (seats 2-5):   0 0 0  0 0 1 1  1 1 0 â†’ bits 2 to 5
Middle block (seats 4-7): 0 0 0  1 1 1 1  0 0 0 â†’ bits 4 to 7
Right block (seats 6-9):  0 1 1  1 1 0 0  0 0 0 â†’ bits 6 to 9

We check if the corresponding bits in the mask are unset â†’ that block is available.
